GraphVisual is a tool written in Racket to produce 
visual representation of a graph. It also includes 
functionalities for 

- random graph generation, and
- a small api for using this in 2htdp/universe 
animations.

Kindly note that this project is work in progress. 
The documentation will be complete as soon as 
possible. However, you can see and run the 
examples for a first impression on how to use it.

See docs for more detailed discussion.
